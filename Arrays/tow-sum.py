# Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
# You can return the answer in any order.

# Approach: Two-pass Hash Table

# Intuition

# To improve our runtime complexity, we need a more efficient way to check if the complement exists in the array. 
# If the complement exists, we need to get its index. What is the best way to maintain a mapping of each element in the array to its index? A hash table.

# We can reduce the lookup time from O(n)O(n) to O(1)O(1) by trading space for speed. 
# A hash table is well suited for this purpose because it supports fast lookup in near constant time. I say "near" because if a collision occurred, a lookup could degenerate to O(n)O(n) time. 
# However, lookup in a hash table should be amortized O(1)O(1) time as long as the hash function was chosen carefully.

# Algorithm

# A simple implementation uses two iterations. In the first iteration, we add each element's value as a key and its index as a value to the hash table. 
# Then, in the second iteration, we check if each element's complement (target - nums[i]targetâˆ’nums[i]) exists in the hash table.
#  If it does exist, we return current element's index and its complement's index. Beware that the complement must not be nums[i]nums[i] itself!


class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        soln = {}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            soln[nums[i]] = i
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            complement = target - nums[i]
            if complement in soln and soln[complement] != i:
                return [i, soln[complement]]
            

# Complexity Analysis

# Time complexity: O(n)O(n). We traverse the list containing nn elements exactly twice. Since the hash table reduces the lookup time to O(1)O(1), the overall time complexity is O(n)O(n).

# Space complexity: O(n)O(n). The extra space required depends on the number of items stored in the hash table, which stores exactly nn elements.
